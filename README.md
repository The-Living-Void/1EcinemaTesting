Three.js test place
the essential parts of the code on a shared place
the idea is to pull it from github when you start, copy it outof the folder into your work folder, test it build it whatever you are doing.
at the end write what you did in the UnitedWorkHistory.txt.
write summary & discription in github and Push it to github :)
